# Animal Detection using YOLO and OpenCV

This project implements animal detection in real-time using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm and OpenCV. 
The application captures a screenshot of the screen and detects animals (like dogs, cats, cows, etc.) in the image using a pre-trained YOLO model.

## Features

- Real-time animal detection using YOLOv3.
- Detects common animals like dogs, cats, cows, horses, and sheep.
- Displays a bounding box around detected animals.
- Tracks and counts total animals detected continuously.
- Customizable window size for displaying the output.
- Clears the screen and restarts detection once an animal is detected.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- pyautogui
- YOLOv3 pre-trained weights and configuration files
- coco.names (class labels for YOLO)
